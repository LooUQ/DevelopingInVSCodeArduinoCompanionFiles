# SEGGER J-Link RTT Support in Visual Studio Code Arduino

Segger J-Link RTT is a facility to support low-impact, data I/O from embedded application under test to a debugging host.

The files here are found in the Segger **J-Link Software and Documentation Pack** available at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack

This files in this folder and subfolders have been reorganized to make them identifiable as an Arduino library. This also required the creation of the library.properties file to allow the Arduino development environment to locate the top-level header (SEGGER_RTT.h) file.
